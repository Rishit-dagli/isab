Set Transformer from the paper "Set Transformer: A Framework for Attention-based Permutation-Invariant Neural Networks" is based on Isab, an attention scheme inspired by inducing point methods from sparse Gaussian process literature and making it permutation invariant. It proposes to reduce attention from O(n¬≤) to O(mn), where m is the number of inducing points (learned latents).


## Installation

Run the following to install:

```sh
pip install isab
```

## Developing isab

To install `isab`, along with tools you need to develop and test, run the following in your virtualenv:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Rishit-dagli/isab.git
# or clone your own fork

cd isab
pip install -e .[dev]
```

To run rank and shape tests run any of the following:

```py
python -m isab.test_isab
pytest isab --verbose
```

## Usage

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from isab import Isab


attn = Isab(
    dim = 512,
    heads = 8,
    num_latents = 128
)

seq = tf.random.normal((1, 16384, 512)) # (batch, seq, dim)
mask = tf.ones((1, 16384), dtype = tf.bool) # (batch, seq)

out, latents = attn(seq, mask = mask) # (1, 16384, 512), (1, 128, 512)
```

You can also choose not to set the number of latents, and pass in the latents yourself:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from isab import Isab


attn = Isab(
    dim = 512,
    heads = 8
)

seq = tf.random.normal((1, 16384, 512)) # (batch, seq, dim)
latents = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal((128, 512))) # some memory, passed through multiple Isabs

out, new_latents = attn(seq, latents) # (1, 16384, 512), (1, 128, 512)
```
